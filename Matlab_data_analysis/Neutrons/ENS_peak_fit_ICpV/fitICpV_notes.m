% Notes on fitICpV class:
% Ideally: 
% * Plot function with subplots if there is a double peak plot
% 
% Steps:
% * Finish adapting compute_fit method for single peak fit
% * Adapt plot_fit method for single peak fit
% * Extend both methods for double peak fit. This might imply creating a
% function for initialization of fit parameters
